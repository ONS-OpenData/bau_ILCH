# Index of Labour Costs per Hour

This script will convert both seasonally adjusted (SA) and non seasonally adjusted (NSA) versions of ILCH (both are usually released together). You can view a typical NSA file here:
http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/indexoflabourcostsperhourilchnonseasonallyadjusted

Please note. We use github for versioning purposes only. If anyone wants the actual data involved it will always be easily accessible via the ONS website (www.ons.gov.uk) and API service.
