# Index of Labour Costs per Hour

This script will convert both seasonally adjusted (SA) and non seasonally adjusted (NSA) versions of ILCH (both are usually released together). You can view a typical NSA file here:

Please note. We use github for versioning purposes only. If anyone wants the actual data involved it will always be easily accessible via the ONS website (www.ons.gov.uk) and API service.
