# Index of Labour Costs per Hour

This script will convert both seasonally adjusted (SA) and non seasonally adjusted (NSA) versions of ILCH (both are usually released together). You can view a typical NSA file here:
http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/indexoflabourcostsperhourilchnonseasonallyadjusted

Please note. We use github for versioning purposes only. If anyone wants the actual data involved it will always be easily accessible via the ONS website (www.ons.gov.uk) and API service.


## Setup & Prep
1.) Download this repository with the "download ZIP" button.

2.) Unzip everything into its own folder.

3.) Drop the reference table(s) to be converted into that folder.



## Usage
1.) Double click the "CLICKTO LAUNCH" batch file.

2.) Select your reference table then run.

3.) Repeat 2.) with the second reference table.


## Structure

This recipe is intended for use with a very specific legacy output structure. If you're a visitor and running (I wouldnt advise it - use the demo), you'll need to use the WDA structure_csv_user.py file stored elsewhere on our github.
